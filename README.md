# replicate-seamless-texture-builder

Get an API-Token from https://replicate.com/

Use this token whereas you type in your terminal: `export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=yourtokengoeshere 
`

start with the python script main.py and type in your terminal as follows`pythyon3 main.py`.
Then the fun part begins. Give free rein to your imagination.

After enterimg you prompt, an AI semaless texture is generated. It takes abou 30 secs and the link will be merged into my database. e.g.: 

the prompt `rusty nails and cheeseballs with green pepper pizza slices` generatetd [https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/RSI8FDgJ8VKjBtVBLKe0a2bdUgP3eb56edXpwNZQPeBcNpzAB/out-0.jpg]()

Then I use this HTML and CSS code to run an infinite background. You just need to open this file in your browser: `pattern-animation-infinite/dist/index.html`

Have fun.
